An analysis of the US Cab data.

1. Step 1: Import Libraries
For this project, we need Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Datetime, XLRD.

2. Step 2: Data Exploration
The various datasets used in this project will explored (viewed).
Obtained full info on the datasets used for the project.

3. Step 3: Data Cleaning
Data sets in use during this analysis will be reviewed and necessary type conversions and deletions made to inhibit errors and improve accuracy.
Conversion of travel dates to date time format.
Changed floats to have just two decimal places
Checked for empty or null or incomplete data cells and removed them.
Made sure that all IDs in the datasets were unique this help to eliminate duplicates.
Conversion of numbers stored as strings to number data type.

4. Step 4: Preliminary Data Visualizations
Use of plots, charts, to display data analysis.
Analysis of data distributions.

5. Step 5: Data Integration
Using the cleaned data, we build relations and merge between the datasets whose fields are of interest to the analysis.
Merge all relevant and cleaned dataset into one dataset to enable ease of tests.

6. Step 6: Time Series Analysis
Compare trends, patterns, or seasonal effects.

7. Step 7: Comparative Data Analysis
Distribution of Cab type usage, Gender usage and Payment mode.
Distribution of City Usage by Cab Type.

8. Step 8: Independent Samples t-test (Profit between two different cab companies)
Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean Profit between two different cab companies.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the mean Profit between two different cab companies.

9. Step 9: Chi-Square Test of Independence (Company and Payment_Mode)
Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the cab company and the payment mode.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between the cab company and the payment mode.

10. Step 10: Pearson's correlation coefficient (Fare and Profit)
Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no linear relationship between Fare and Profit.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a linear relationship between Fare and Profit.

11. Chi-Square Test of Independence (Age and Payment Mode)

12. Conclusion and Key Takeaways
